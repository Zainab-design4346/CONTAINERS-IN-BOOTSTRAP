    <h3> 1.Swimming</h3>
    <p>Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, such as saltwater or freshwater environments, usually for
    recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Swimmers achieve locomotion by coordinating limb and body movements to achieve
    hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Newborns can instinctively hold their breath underwater and
    exhibit rudimentary swimming movements as part of a survival reflex. Swimming requires endurance, skill and efficient
    techniques to maximize speed and minimize energy consumption.</p>

    <h3>2.Painting</h3>
    <p>Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a
    solid surface (called "matrix"[1] or "support").[2] The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush. Other
    implements, such as palette knives, sponges, airbrushes, the artist's fingers, or even a dripping technique that uses
    gravity may be used. One who produces paintings is called a painter.</p>
